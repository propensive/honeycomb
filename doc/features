- simple method-application style for constructing HTML nodes
- nodes and sequences of nodes may be embedded and mixed inside HTML nodes
- the type of a node defines the valid types of its child nodes, enforcing the HTML5 specification through the type system
- values of other types may be embedded in HTML, if an appropriate typeclass instance exists
- a simple named-parameter style is provided for HTML attributes
- HTML attributes are strongly-typed, and the types accepted by each are defined by typeclasses
